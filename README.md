# Solar_System
Made by Ed Wright
A model of our Solar System.
The sizes of objects are proportional to each other, as are the distances between them. However, the sizes of objects are not proportional to the distances between them.

Installation: Download the repository as a zip folder. Inside, there are three folders: Build, Documentation, and Source. The "Build" folder contains and an cutable called "Tiny Planets" (the name is residual from an earlier project concept). The "Source" folder contains all of the assets and code for the project. "Documentation" contains a GUI mockup and testing results.
